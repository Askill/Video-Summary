# Default Configuration for Video Summary
# This is a YAML configuration file with explanatory comments

# Contour detection parameters
min_area: 300           # Minimum contour area in pixels (smaller contours ignored)
max_area: 900000        # Maximum contour area in pixels (larger contours ignored)
threshold: 7            # Luminance difference threshold for movement detection (lower = more sensitive)

# Video processing
resizeWidth: 700        # Video width for processing (reduces memory usage and speeds up processing)
videoBufferLength: 250  # Number of frames to buffer in memory

# Layer management
maxLayerLength: 5000    # Maximum length of a layer in frames
minLayerLength: 40      # Minimum length of a layer in frames (shorter layers discarded)
tolerance: 20           # Maximum distance in pixels between contours to group into same layer
ttolerance: 50          # Number of frames a movement can be absent before creating a new layer
LayersPerContour: 220   # Maximum number of layers a single contour can belong to

# Advanced options
avgNum: 10              # Number of frames to average before calculating difference
                        # Higher values reduce noise but increase computation time
                        # Useful for outdoor scenes with clouds, wind, etc.
